New year, new faces…similar names. Today, Margo Favier joined our lab. As a Master’s student Margo will be working with both Margaux (with aux!) and Steven on circadian rhythms in 2D as well as 3D cultures of PSC-CMs. We are happy to have you in the lab and looking forward to all the cool science that we’ll do together. Welcome to the team!
